This notebook especillay showcase how transfer learning can be applied based on the EfficientNet model.

We create a model based on two input, the first one being the RGB vector from the given pictures and the second one being a vector representing some metadata that have been manually labelled by the organizer of the competition.

Our best score with the presented approach is a **RMSE** of **18.81** that allowed us to rank ~Top50% on the public leaderboard (temporary standings as the competition is not over as this notebook is being published).
